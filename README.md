# JavaScript Everywhere

A SXSW Interactive 2017 Workshop

## About the Workshop

(Video introduction coming soon!)

Recent advances now allow us build for every platform with JavaScript. React Native for mobile. Electron for desktop. React for web. And Node.js for backend.

Single language development is a CTO’s holy grail. Gone are the days of paying four teams to build the same thing in different languages. Here are the days of hyper-efficient dev where business logic is implemented once, then shared everywhere.

Or are they?

In this session we’ll give you the no BS guided tour of what a real JavaScript everywhere ecosystem looks like. No theories or concepts. Just real life experience and working code. We’ll answer all your questions so you can make JS-related stack decisions with confidence.

## Requirements

### Experience

No specific technical experience is necessary to attend this workshop, however you'll get the most out of it if you are familiar with JavaScript, and have at some point considered introducing JavaScript into your product's tech stack.

### Technical

There are zero technical requirements for this workshop! If you'd like, you may bring a computer to browse the source code of the applications we discuss.

## About the Instructors

[Lawson](https://www.viget.com/about/team/lkurtz) and [Nate](https://www.viget.com/about/team/nhunzaker) are senior software engineers at Viget. They've built dozens of web applications for clients around the world ranging from Y-Combinator partners to Fortune 500s to stealth start ups (and a few just for ourselves). Recently they find themselves working almost exclusively on JavaScript applications for numerous platforms. They presented [a workshop on building native mobile apps with JavaScript](http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP53622) last year at SXSW, and are eager to return for this natural continuation of the topic.

### Lawson Kurtz
_Boulder, CO_

Lawson works as a software engineer for Viget building apps for clients in Ruby and JavaScript. The breadth of his work at Viget spans a wide gamut from an investment portal for a private equity firm, to core development on a top blogging platform, to API development for a major identity verification service. In addition to his consultant engineering work at Viget, Lawson serves as tech director and chief engineer to a 4-year NIH grant for the extension of his research building educational software tools at the Duke University School of Medicine. Lawson has over 6 years of experience creating software for the web, more recently adopting a strong focus on client-side and native applications, co-directing the client-side app engineering interest group at Viget. Away from the office, Lawson works with non-profits such as the Duke Center for Science Education and the KIPP Foundation, developing software to improve K-12 education.

Lawson has over 6 years of experience creating software for the web, and has expert knowledge of Ruby and JavaScript. As a consultant engineer, Lawson has the unique opportunity to plan, build, and deliver a wide variety of apps from scratch on a regular basis, allowing for the constant adoption of the latest technologies, and the development of a broadly applicable skill set. Most recently, Lawson and his colleagues at Viget have been most interested in JavaScript projects, and have amassed considerable expertise in the planning and development of multi-platform JavaScript applications.


### Nate Hunzaker
_Durham, NC_

Nate Hunzaker is a JavaScript engineer at Viget, a full-service web agency. There he spends his time writing web applications, interactive data visualizations, and playing with (and contributing to) the latest open-source web technologies.

Over the past 6 years, Nate has developed considerable expertise writing web applications with JavaScript. His familiarity with the React library is nearly unparalleled. Nate is a React core contributor, and has authored several additional open-source JavaScript libraries for building applications with React, including the popular implementation of the Flux architecture, Microcosm. Nate’s background in traditional JavaScript development, coupled with his intricate knowledge of all things React, makes him an ideal instructor for this JavaScript everywhere workshop.
